# Dictionary
This program allows us to create a dictionary: we can introduce a word with a translation to as many languages as we want and the word and its translations are saved in a database (I used Oracle database). The program allows us to save new words in the dictionary, search a specific word in the dictionary, search all the words that meet a certain parameter (for example, start with a letter "R", or contain a combination "ed" etc.) and delete words from the dictionary.
